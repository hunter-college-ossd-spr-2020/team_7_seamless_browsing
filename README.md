### Team 7: Seamless Browsing Add-On
### Jessica Wong, Matthew Liang, Umar Khan

# Description
Team 7's Add-On Idea to help with seamless web browsing! Our idea is to create an extension that adds a button on the bottom right corner of the screen. When a user clicks on it, it will seamlessly scroll back to the top of the page. 

We also plan to add a new feature, add another button that, when clicked, will change your browser page's zoom/screen resolution.
